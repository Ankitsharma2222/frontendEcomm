# FastKart EcommerceWebite
The goal of project was to get an hands on experience and learn more skills in MERN stack Development and related technologies like Material UI,JWT etc.

The project development started in february 2023 . Initially the frontend was developed including the home page ,Profile page ,Cart and Orders. The backend development also started parallelly which includes creating models for buyer,seller,products,orders,reviews along with REST Api's .To store the images of products , we used an cloud based image storage "Cloudinary" ,which increases the scalability of projects. We rely on jwt for authorisation of every user and encryption of credentials for providing a secure exprience.. AS of now the product also contain frontend Pages for seller which includes Product Catlog,Seller Profile,Add Product and Edit Product with thier equivalent backend controllers.

Responsive Design: OurWeb-application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Users can enjoy seamless navigation and functionality, regardless of their preferred device. Material-UI Integration: We leverage the power of Material-UI, a popular React UI framework, to enhance the visual aesthetics and user interface of our e-commerce platform. The implementation of Material-UI components ensures a modern and visually appealing design that is both intuitive and familiar to users. Buyer-Friendly Interface: With a responsive and Material-UI-powered design, our platform offers buyers a user-friendly interface. They can easily browse through product categories, search for items, and complete transactions seamlessly, enhancing their overall shopping experience. Seller Empowerment: Our platform provides sellers with the tools they need to effectively showcase and sell their products. Through a user-friendly dashboard, sellers can create and manage product listings, increase inventory, and update product.. Customization and Personalization: Buyers and sellers have the ability to customize their profiles with very ease. Scalability: Built on the scalable MERN stack, our e-commerce platform is capable of accommodating a growing number of users, products, and transactions without compromising performance. It ensures a seamless experience, even during periods of high traffic because the larger assets like images are stored on a different cloud instead of encoding them and database is structured as the documents can be found with minimal efforts. . Enhanced Security: We use latest technologies like "jwt" and hashing of information ensuring the privacy and protection of sensitive information

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
